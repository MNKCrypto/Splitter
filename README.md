# Splitter
Splitter is an ethereum based DAPP.

This application has a smart contract with following two functions,

# addReciever 
  This function will allow users to add user addresses among which they will be splitting the ether.
# splitEther 
  This function when called from an user account, will split the transferred ether among the receivers added.

Users will have to decide on the maximum receiver count at the time contract deployment and define it in the Truffle configuration.
